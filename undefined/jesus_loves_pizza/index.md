The fairy queen sent me these pictures.

They have me deeply tickled.

Splice poetry, almost. The evangelical transition from divine to mundane cut off by the commercial.

"Jesus loves ~~you~~ pizza"

"Believe in Jesus, receive ~~eternal life~~ Vietnamese bride, $25k.

"Jesus sacrificed himself and resurrected [the japanese rhinoceros bettle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_rhinoceros_beetle)"

"Have faith in Jesus and get ~~eternal life~~ buffalo (永生 becomes 水牛 if you delete some of the strokes)"

"Jesus came to the world to bring ~~whatever it's supposed to be~~ test prep"

and, the worst one of them all,

"Believe in Jesus, get ... a Vietnamese bride"
