# Flinching

Trauma is big and serious. If you have trauma you're crazy and unpredictable. Who? Me? Trauma? Never heard of her! Wouldn't know it's her even if I'm seeing her.

Flinching is easy to identify. You know what somebody else flinching looks like. You might be able to extrapolate from there to see when you yourself flinch.

So that you can be brave.
