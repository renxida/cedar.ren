# Update Terms and Types Index Pages

## Task
Update the index pages for `/terms/index.md` and `/types/index.md` to include links to all pages in their respective directories.

## Instructions

### For `/terms/index.md`:
1. Find all pages under the `/terms/` directory (excluding `index.md` itself)
2. After the existing introductory text, add a section titled `## All Terms`
3. List each term as a bullet point with the format:
   - `- [Term Name](/terms/path_to_file)`
   - Use the actual filename (without extension) as the display name, replacing underscores with spaces and capitalizing appropriately
   - Include files with any extension (.md, .txt, etc.)
   - Sort alphabetically

### For `/types/index.md`:
1. Find all pages under the `/types/` directory (excluding `index.md` itself)
2. After the existing introductory text, add a section titled `## All Types`
3. List each type as a bullet point with the format:
   - `- [Type Name](/types/path_to_file)`
   - Use the actual filename (without extension) as the display name, replacing underscores with spaces and capitalizing appropriately
   - Sort alphabetically

## Example Output

For terms/index.md:
```markdown
# Terms

[Terms](/terms/) enter [Cedar's](/) theory when they inhabit a [type](/types/).

## All Terms

- [Bits](/terms/bits/)
- [Blessed Hills](/terms/blessed_hills)
- [Dark Matter](/terms/dark_matter)
```

For types/index.md:
```markdown
# Types

[Types](/types/) prescribe [terms](/terms/). [Types](/types/) bring [terms](/terms/) to [Cedar](/).

## All Types

- [Do a Bit](/types/do_a_bit)
- [Flinch](/types/flinch)
```

## Notes
- Preserve the existing introductory text at the top of each index file
- Only add/update the "All Terms" or "All Types" section
- Handle both directories and individual files
- For directories, link to the directory path (e.g., `/terms/bits/`)
- For files, link to the file without extension if it's .md, or with extension for other types (e.g., `/terms/zhuge.txt`)
