# Where is Cedar?

[The government knows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4zH9Zca1vRM) where Cedar is. It'd be weird if friends don't. If you're a friend and don't know Cedar's location, consider one of the following remedies:
- Ask Cedar to share location on Google Maps
- Dismantle global mass surveillance
- Introduce Cedar and the government and make them friends!
