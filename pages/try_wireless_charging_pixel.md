# Try Wirelessly Charging your Google Pixel before sending it in for repairs

If your Google Pixel 7 has a black screen and won't charge, try wireless charging before giving up.

My Pixel 7 became totally unresponsive - black screen, wouldn't charge via USB-C no matter what I tried:

- Holding power button for 1 minute
- Power button + volume up
- Power button + volume up + volume down
- Charging for half an hour on USB-C
- Charging for half an hour on USB-A to USB-C

Nothing worked.

**But wireless charging for 10 minutes got the phone to boot.** After that, normal USB-C charging worked again.

I suspect this happens when the phone runs out of power while the charging port debris detection is active (possibly from moisture). This locks it into an unchargeable state that only wireless charging can break.
