# Galaxies are Space Puddles

In the beginning, there were [dimples in space](/pages/dark_matter). Then the stars fell into the dimples, and formed the puddles we now call galaxies. I know this because [Katherine Freese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Freese) [said so](http://archive.today/2025.07.25-235331/https://ned.ipac.caltech.edu/level5/Sept17/Freese/Freese2.html).

This came to me during a conversation with [Korvain](/pages/korvain).
