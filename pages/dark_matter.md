# Dark Matter

- gravity
- clumps
- doesn't interact with light or otherwise electromagnetically
- we don't know about the weak / strong nuclear forces but given how much they can clump without becoming something else that interacts electromagnetically, they're probably nuclear-force inert.

That doesn't feel very matter-ey!

Dark matter should really be called space puddles.

[Galaxies form around space puddles](/pages/galaxies_are_space_puddles).
