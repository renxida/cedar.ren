# Debugging Google Pixel 7 Black Screen / Won't Charge

Phone screen black. Px7. Totally unresponsive.

I tried:

- power button 1min
- power button + up volume
- power button + up volum + down volume
- charging for half an hour on usbc
- charging for half an hour on usba->usbc

Nothing worked.

But wireless charging for 10min got the phone to boot. And after that normal charging worked.

I suspect it has to do with the charging port debris detection. Last time I was using the phone I was eating with a friend at a restaurant and we spilled a little bit of water onto the table. I think the phone ran out of power while charging-port debris detection was active, locking it into an uncharge-able state that took wireless charging to get out of.
